# Magic gap analyzer

Welcome to the magic gap analyzer!
This app was built as a tool for anyone who wants to know:

What am I missing from my collection to build this deck?

With magic the gathering arena, you can easily see a list
that marks all the cards you're missing with red text. However,
when you have a physical list, a tool like this might be handy as well!

## Local development

In order to run the application, you need to do the following:

### install

```shell
npm install
```

### Run application

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Build

This application is using github pages with github actions.
With this, the app will automatically build and push the new version
after successful builds, tests, and linting happens.
